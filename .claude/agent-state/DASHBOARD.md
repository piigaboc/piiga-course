## How work flows

1. **Plan** — `lead` decomposes a feature into ordered steps, each assigned to one specialist.
2. **Build** — main session runs each step via the assigned agent (parallel where independent).
3. **Gate** — `reviewer` (correctness/security) then `qa` (tests) before a feature is "done".

## Live runtime status

For agents actually running right now (in-progress / completed / failed), this static roster does
**not** track that — use the live task list or the `/workflows` view instead. This file is the squad
overview and a place to jot the current assignment per agent.
